### Inheritance

**You can make a class <tooltip content="define a new class based on an existing class">inherit</tooltip> from another class.** If you do, it is as if the <tooltip content="the new class">_child class_</tooltip> already has all the attributes and methods of the <tooltip content="the class that was inherited from">_parent class_</tooltip>.

Syntax:
```python
class ChildClassName(ParentClassName):
  # statements of the class
```
