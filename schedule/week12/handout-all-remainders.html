              <p><strong>Abstraction</strong> is a technique for dealing with complexity. It works by establishing a level of complexity (or an aspect) we are interested in, and suppressing the more complex details below that level (or irrelevant to that
                aspect).</p>

          <p>Most programs are written to solve complex problems involving large amounts of intricate details. It is impossible to deal with all these details at the same time. The guiding principle of abstraction stipulates that we capture only details

              <p><strong><em>Model-driven development (MDD)</em>, also called <em>Model-driven engineering</em>, is an approach to software development that strives to exploits models as blueprints.</strong> MDD uses models as primary engineering artifacts
                when developing software. That is, the system is first created in the form of models. After that, the models are converted to code using code-generation techniques (usually, automated or semi-automated, but can even involve manual translation
                from model to code). MDD requires the use of a very expressive modeling notation (graphical or otherwise), often specific to a given problem domain. It also requires sophisticated tools to generate code from models and maintain the link
                between models and the code. One advantage of MDD is that the same model can be used to create software for different platforms and different languages. MDD has a lot of promise, but it is still an emerging technology</p>

          <ul>
            <li>The reused code <strong>may be an overkill</strong> (think <em>using a sledgehammer to crack a nut</em>) increasing the size of, or/and degrading the performance of, your software.</li>
            <li>The reused software <strong>may not be mature/stable enough</strong> to be used in an important product. That means the software can change drastically and rapidly, possibly in ways that break your software.</li>
            <li>Non-mature software has the <strong>risk of dying off</strong> as fast as they emerged, leaving you with a dependency that is no longer maintained.</li>
            <li>The license of the reused software (or its dependencies) <strong>restrict how you can use/develop your software</strong>.</li>
            <li>The reused software <strong>might have bugs, missing features, or security vulnerabilities</strong> that are important to your product but not so important to the maintainers of that software, which means those flaws will not get fixed as
              fast as you need them to.</li>

          <p><strong>Cloud computing is the delivery of computing as a service over the network</strong>, rather than a product running on a local machine. This means the actual hardware and software is located at a remote location, typically, at a large
            server farm, while users access them over the network. Maintenance of the hardware and software is managed by the cloud provider while users typically pay for only the amount of services they use. This model is similar to the consumption of
            electricity; the power company manages the power plant, while the consumers pay them only for the electricity used. The cloud computing model optimizes hardware and software utilization and reduces the cost to consumers. Furthermore, users
            can scale up/down their utilization at will without having to upgrade their hardware and software. The traditional non-cloud model of computing is similar to everyone buying their own generators to create electricity for their own use.</p>

          <ol>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Infrastructure as a service (IaaS) delivers computer infrastructure as a service.</strong> For example, a user can deploy virtual servers on the cloud instead of buying physical hardware and installing server software on them. Another
                example would be a customer using storage space on the cloud for off-site storage of data. <span class="dimmed"> Rackspace is an example of an IaaS cloud provider. Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) is another one.</span></p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Platform as a service (PaaS) provides a platform on which developers can build applications.</strong> Developers do not have to worry about infrastructure issues such as deploying servers or load balancing as is required when using
                IaaS. Those aspects are automatically taken care of by the platform. The price to pay is reduced flexibility; applications written on PaaS are limited to facilities provided by the platform. <span class="dimmed"> A PaaS example is the Google App Engine where developers can build applications using Java, Python, PHP, or Go whereas Amazon EC2 allows users to deploy application written in any language on their virtual servers.</span></p>

              <p><strong>Software as a service (SaaS) allows applications to be accessed over the network</strong> instead of installing them on a local machine. <span class="dimmed"> For example, Google Docs is an SaaS word processing software, while Microsoft Word is a traditional word processing software.</span></p>

            <li><strong>Documentation for <em>developer-as-maintainer</em></strong>: There is a need to document how a system or a component is designed, implemented and tested so that other developers can maintain and evolve the code. Writing documentation
              of this type is harder because of the need to explain complex internal details. However, given that readers of this type of documentation usually have access to the source code itself, only <em>some</em> information need to be included in
              the documentation, as code (and code comments) can also serve as a complementary source of information.</li>

          <p>Here are some tips on writing effective documentation.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Use plenty of diagrams</strong>: It is not enough to explain something in words; complement it with visual illustrations (e.g. a UML diagram).</li>
            <li><strong>Use plenty of examples</strong>: When explaining algorithms, show a running example to illustrate each step of the algorithm, in parallel to worded explanations.</li>
            <li><strong>Use simple and direct explanations</strong>: Convoluted explanations and fancy words will annoy readers. Avoid long sentences.</li>
            <li><strong>Get rid of statements that do not add value</strong>: For example, 'We made sure our system works perfectly' (who didn't?), 'Component X has its own responsibilities' (of course it has!).</li>
            <li><strong>It is not a good idea to have separate sections for each type of artifact</strong>, such as 'use cases', 'sequence diagrams', 'activity diagrams', etc. Such a structure, coupled with the indiscriminate inclusion of diagrams without
              justifying their need, indicates a failure to understand the purpose of documentation. Include diagrams when they are needed to explain something. If you want to provide additional diagrams for completeness' sake, include them in the appendix
              as a reference.</li>

            <li>Writing and maintaining developer documents is an overhead. You should try to minimize that overhead.</li>
            <li>If the readers are developers who will eventually read the code, the documentation should complement the code and should provide only just enough guidance to get started.</li>

        </div>
        <div>
          <p>Anything that is already clear in the code need not be described in words. Instead, <strong>focus on providing higher level information that is not readily visible in the code or comments</strong>.</p>
          <p>Refrain from duplicating chunks or text. When describing several similar algorithms/designs/APIs, etc., do not simply duplicate large chunks of text. Instead, <strong>describe the similarity in one place and emphasize only the differences in other places.</strong>            It is very annoying to see pages and pages of similar text without any indication as to how they differ from each other.</p>

          <p><strong><em>Revision Control Software (RCS)</em> are the software tools that automate the process of <em>Revision Control</em> i.e. managing revisions of software artifacts.</strong></p>
          <p>Revision control is also known as <em>Version Control Software (VCS)</em>, and a few other names. Here, we use the terms <em>revision</em> and <em>version</em> interchangeably.</p>

              <blockquote>
                <p><em>Revision control</em> is the process of managing multiple versions of a piece of information. In its simplest form, this is something that many people do by hand: every time you modify a file, save it under a new name that contains
                  a number, each one higher than the number of the preceding version.</p>
                <p>Manually managing multiple versions of even a single file is an error-prone task, though, so software tools to help automate this process have long been available. The earliest automated revision control tools were intended to help a single
                  user to manage revisions of a single file. Over the past few decades, the scope of revision control tools has expanded greatly; they now manage multiple files, and help multiple people to work together. The best modern revision control
                  tools have no problem coping with thousands of people working together on projects that consist of hundreds of thousands of files.</p>
                <p>There are a number of reasons why you or your team might want to use an automated revision control tool for a project. It will track the history and evolution of your project, so you don't have to. For every change, you'll have a log of
                  who made it; why they made it; when they made it; and what the change was.</p>
                <p>When you're working with other people, <strong>revision control software makes it easier for you to collaborate</strong>. For example, when people more or less simultaneously make potentially incompatible changes, the software will help
                  you to identify and resolve those conflicts.</p>
                <p><strong>It can help you to recover from mistakes</strong>. If you make a change that later turns out to be an error, you can revert to an earlier version of one or more files. In fact, a really good revision control tool will even help
                  you to efficiently figure out exactly when a problem was introduced.</p>
                <p><strong>It will help you to work simultaneously on, and manage the drift between, multiple versions of your project.</strong> Most of these reasons are equally valid, at least in theory, whether you're working on a project by yourself,
                  or with a hundred other people.</p>
