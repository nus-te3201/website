          <p><strong><em>Unit testing</em> : testing individual units (methods, classes, subsystems, ...) to ensure each piece works correctly.</strong></p>

          <p><strong><em>System testing</em>: take the <em>whole system</em> and test it <em>against the system specification</em>.</strong></p>
          <p>System testing is typically done by a testing team (also called a QA team).</p>
          <p><strong>System test cases are based on the specified external behavior of the system.</strong> Sometimes, system tests go beyond the bounds defined in the specification. This is useful when testing that the system fails 'gracefully' having pushed
            beyond its limits.</p>
          <tip-box>
            <p>📦 Suppose the SUT is a browser supposedly capable of handling web pages containing up to 5000 characters. Given below is a test case to test if the SUT fails gracefully if pushed beyond its limits.</p>
            <pre class="hljs"><code>Test case: load a web page that is too big
* Input: load a web page containing more than 5000 characters. 
* Expected behavior: abort the loading of the page and show a meaningful error message. 
</code></pre>
            <p>This test case would fail if the browser attempted to load the large file anyway and crashed.</p>
          </tip-box>
          <p><strong>System testing includes testing against non-functional requirements too.</strong> Here are some examples.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><em>Performance testing</em> – to ensure the system responds quickly.</li>
            <li><em>Load testing</em> (also called <em>stress testing</em> or <em>scalability testing</em>) – to ensure the system can work under heavy load.</li>
            <li><em>Security testing</em> – to test how secure the system is.</li>
            <li><em>Compatibility testing, interoperability testing</em> – to check whether the system can work with other systems.</li>
            <li><em>Usability testing</em> – to test how easy it is to use the system.</li>
            <li><em>Portability testing</em> – to test whether the system works on different platforms.</li>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>Locating the cause of such a test case failure is difficult due to a large search space;</strong> in a large system, the search space could be millions of lines of code, written by hundreds of developers! The failure may also be due
              to multiple inter-related bugs.</li>
            <li><strong>Fixing a bug found during such testing could result in major rework</strong>, especially if the bug originated during the design or during requirements specification <span class="dimmed">i.e. a faulty design or faulty requirements</span>.</li>
            <li><strong>One bug might 'hide' other bugs</strong>, which could emerge only after the first bug is fixed.</li>
            <li><strong>The delivery may have to be delayed</strong> if too many bugs were found during testing.</li>
          </ul>

            <p><strong>Requirement Specification vs System Specification</strong></p>

            <p>However, <strong>in many cases one document serves as both a requirement specification and a system specification.</strong></p>
          </tip-box>
          <p><strong>Passing system tests does not necessarily mean passing acceptance testing.</strong> Some examples:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The system might work on the testbed environments but might not work the same way in the deployment environment, due to subtle differences between the two environments.</li>
            <li>The system might conform to the system specification but could fail to solve the problem it was supposed to solve for the user, due to flaws in the system design.</li>

          <ol>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Scripted testing:</strong> First write a set of test cases based on the expected behavior of the SUT, and then perform testing based on that set of test cases.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Exploratory testing:</strong> Devise test cases on-the-fly, creating new test cases based on the results of the past test cases.</p>
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>Exploratory testing is ‘the simultaneous learning, test design, and test execution’
            <trigger trigger="click" for="modal:exploratoryWhat-bach-et-explained">[source: bach-et-explained]</trigger> whereby the nature of the follow-up test case is decided based on the behavior of the previous test cases. In other words, running the system and trying out various operations. It is called <em>exploratory testing</em>            because testing is driven by observations during testing. Exploratory testing usually starts with areas identified as error-prone, based on the tester’s past experience with similar systems. One tends to conduct more tests for those operations
            where more faults are found.</p>
          <tip-box>
            <p>📦 Here is an example thought process behind a segment of an exploratory testing session:</p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>“Hmm... looks like feature x is broken. This usually means feature n and k could be broken too; we need to look at them soon. But before that, let us give a good test run to feature y because users can still use the product if feature y
                works, even if x doesn’t work. Now, if feature y doesn’t work 100%, we have a major problem and this has to be made known to the development team sooner rather than later...”</p>

          <p>Which approach is better – <strong>scripted or exploratory? A mix is better.</strong></p>
          <p><strong>The success of exploratory testing depends on the tester’s prior experience and intuition.</strong> Exploratory testing should be done by experienced testers, using a clear strategy/plan/framework. Ad-hoc exploratory testing by unskilled
            or inexperienced testers without a clear strategy is not recommended for real-world non-trivial systems. While <strong>exploratory testing may allow us to detect some problems in a relatively short time, it is not prudent to use exploratory testing as the sole means of testing a critical system</strong>.</p>
          <p><strong>Scripted testing is more systematic, and hence, likely to discover more bugs given sufficient time</strong>, while exploratory testing would aid in quick error discovery, especially if the tester has a lot of experience in testing similar
            systems.</p>

            <li>

          <p>It is inefficient and impractical to test this method for all integer values <code>[-MIN_INT to MAX_INT]</code>. Fortunately, there is no need to test all possible input values. For example, if the input value <code>233</code> failed to produce
            the correct result, the input <code>234</code> is likely to fail too; there is no need to test both.</p>
          <p>In general, <strong>most SUTs do not treat each input in a unique way. Instead, they process all possible inputs in a small number of distinct ways.</strong> That means a range of inputs is treated the same way inside the SUT.

          <p>Note that the EP technique is merely a heuristic and not an exact science, especially when applied manually (as opposed to using an automated program analysis tool to derive EPs). The partitions derived depend on how one ‘speculates’ the SUT

            points of the boundary are often used in branching instructions etc. where the programmer can make mistakes.</p>
          <tip-box>
            <p>📦 <code>markCellAt(int x, int y)</code> operation could contain code such as if <code>(x &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; x &lt;= (W-1))</code> which involves boundaries of x’s equivalence partitions.</p>
          </tip-box>
          <p><strong>BVA suggests that when picking test inputs from an equivalence partition, values near boundaries (i.e. boundary values) are more likely to find bugs.</strong></p>
          <p>Boundary values are sometimes called <em>corner cases</em>.</p>

          <p><strong>Typically, we choose three values around the boundary to test: one value from the boundary, one value just below the boundary, and one value just above the boundary.</strong> The number of values to pick depends on other factors, such
            as the cost of each test case.</p>

          <p><strong>Quality Assurance = Validation + Verification</strong></p>
          <p>QA involves checking two aspects:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Validation: are we <em>building the right system</em> i.e., are the requirements correct?</li>
            <li>Verification: are we <em>building the system right</em> i.e., are the requirements implemented correctly?</li>
          </ol>
          <p>Whether something belongs under validation or verification is not that important. What is more important is both are done, instead of limiting to verification (i.e., remember that the requirements can be wrong too).</p>

                  <p>Pair programming is an agile software development technique in which two programmers work together at one workstation. One, the driver, writes code while the other, the observer or navigator, reviews each line of code as it is typed
                    in. The two programmers switch roles frequently. <sub>[<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming">source: Wikipedia</a>]</sub></p>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p>Inspections involve a group of people systematically examining a project artifacts to discover defects. Members of the inspection team play various roles during the process, such as:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>the author - the creator of the artifact</li>
                    <li>the moderator - the planner and executor of the inspection meeting</li>
                    <li>the secretary - the recorder of the findings of the inspection</li>
                    <li>the inspector/reviewer - the one who inspects/reviews the artifact.</li>

              <p><strong>Static analysis</strong>: Static analysis is the analysis of code without actually executing the code.</p>
            </div>
          </tip-box>
          <p>Static analysis of code can find useful information such unused variables, unhandled exceptions, style errors, and statistics. Most modern IDEs come with some inbuilt static analysis capabilities. For example, an IDE can highlight unused variables
            as you type the code into the editor.</p>
          <p>Higher-end static analyzer tools can perform for more complex analysis such as locating potential bugs, memory leaks, inefficient code structures etc.</p>

          <p>Disadvantages:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>It only proves the compliance with the specification, but not the actual utility of the software.</li>
            <li>It requires highly specialized notations and knowledge which makes it an expensive technique to administer. Therefore, <strong>formal verifications are more commonly used in safety-critical software such as flight control systems</strong>.</li>
