                <p>The following description of the <em>Joys of the Programming Craft</em> was taken from Chapter 1 of the famous book
                  <trigger for="modal:mmm" trigger="click"><em>The Mythical Man-Month</em>, by Frederick P. Brooks</trigger>.</p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p><strong>Why is programming fun? What delights may its practitioner expect as his reward?</strong></p>
                  <p>First is the sheer joy of making things. As the child delights in his mud pie, so the adult enjoys building things, especially things of his own design. I think this delight must be an image of God's delight in making things, a delight
                    shown in the distinctness and newness of each leaf and each snowflake.</p>
                  <p>Second is the pleasure of making things that are useful to other people. Deep within, we want others to use our work and to find it helpful. In this respect the programming system is not essentially different from the child's first clay
                    pencil holder &quot;for Daddy's office.&quot;</p>
                  <p>Third is the fascination of fashioning complex puzzle-like objects of interlocking moving parts and watching them work in subtle cycles, playing out the consequences of principles built in from the beginning. The programmed computer
                    has all the fascination of the pinball machine or the jukebox mechanism, carried to the ultimate.</p>
                  <p>Fourth is the joy of always learning, which springs from the nonrepeating nature of the task. In one way or another the problem is ever new, and its solver learns something: sometimes practical, sometimes theoretical, and sometimes both.</p>
                  <p>Finally, there is the delight of working in such a tractable medium. The programmer, like the poet, works only slightly removed from pure thought-stuff. He builds his castles in the air, from air, creating by the exertion of the imagination.
                    Few media of creation are so flexible, so easy to polish and rework, so readily capable of realizing grand conceptual structures....</p>
                  <p>Yet the program construct, unlike the poet's words, is real in the sense that it moves and works, producing visible outputs separate from the construct itself. It prints results, draws pictures, produces sounds, moves arms. The magic
                    of myth and legend has come true in our time. One types the correct incantation on a keyboard, and a display screen comes to life, showing things that never were nor could be.</p>
                  <p>Programming then is fun because it gratifies creative longings built deep within us and delights sensibilities we have in common with all men.</p>
                </blockquote>
                <blockquote>
                  <p><strong>Not all is delight, however, and knowing the inherent woes makes it easier to bear them when they appear.</strong></p>
                  <p>First, one must perform perfectly. The computer resembles the magic of legend in this respect, too. If one character, one pause, of the incantation is not strictly in proper form, the magic doesn't work. Human beings are not accustomed
                    to being perfect, and few areas of human activity demand it. Adjusting to the requirement for perfection is, I think, the most difficult part of learning to program.</p>
                  <p>Next, other people set one's objectives, provide one's resources, and furnish one's information. One rarely controls the circumstances of his work, or even its goal. In management terms, one's authority is not sufficient for his responsibility.
                    It seems that in all fields, however, the jobs where things get done never have formal authority commensurate with responsibility. In practice, actual (as opposed to formal) authority is acquired from the very momentum of accomplishment.</p>
                  <p>The dependence upon others has a particular case that is especially painful for the system programmer. He depends upon other people's programs. These are often maldesigned, poorly implemented, incompletely delivered (no source code or
                    test cases), and poorly documented. So he must spend hours studying and fixing things that in an ideal world would be complete, available, and usable.</p>
                  <p>The next woe is that designing grand concepts is fun; finding nitty little bugs is just work. With any creative activity come dreary hours of tedious, painstaking labor, and programming is no exception.</p>
                  <p>Next, one finds that debugging has a linear convergence, or worse, where one somehow expects a quadratic sort of approach to the end. So testing drags on and on, the last difficult bugs taking more time to find than the first.</p>
                  <p>The last woe, and sometimes the last straw, is that the product over which one has labored so long appears to be obsolete upon (or before) completion. Already colleagues and competitors are in hot pursuit of new and better ideas. Already
                    the displacement of one's thought-child is not only conceived, but scheduled.</p>
                  <p>This always seems worse than it really is. The new and better product is generally not available when one completes his own; it is only talked about. It, too, will require months of development. The real tiger is never a match for the
                    paper one, unless actual use is wanted. Then the virtues of reality have a satisfaction all their own.</p>
                  <p>Of course the technological base on which one builds is always advancing. As soon as one freezes a design, it becomes obsolete in terms of its concepts. But implementation of real products demands phasing and quantizing. The obsolescence
                    of an implementation must be measured against other existing implementations, not against unrealized concepts. The challenge and the mission are to find real solutions to real problems on actual schedules with available resources.</p>
                  <p>This then is programming, both a tar pit in which many efforts have floundered and a creative activity with joys and woes all its own. For many, the joys far outweigh the woes....</p>

                  <p><em>The Mythical Man-Month: Essays on Software Engineering</em> is a book on software engineering and project management by Fred Brooks, whose central theme is that &quot;adding manpower to a late software project makes it later&quot;.
                    This idea is known as Brooks's law, and is presented along with the second-system effect and advocacy of prototyping.</p>

                              <li>If coding is a manufacturing activity, we wouldn’t be changing it so much after we code software. But if the code is in fact a ‘design’, yes, we would fiddle with it until we get it right.</li>
                              <li>Manufacturing is the process of building a finished product based on the design. Code is the design. Manufacturing is what is done by the compiler (fully automated).</li>

              <blockquote>
                <p><strong>Variables are used to store information to be referenced and manipulated in a computer program.</strong> They also provide a way of labeling data with a descriptive name, so our programs can be understood more clearly by the reader
                  and ourselves. It is helpful to think of variables as containers that hold information. Their sole purpose is to label and store data in memory. This data can then be used throughout your program. <sub>--<a href="https://launchschool.com/books/ruby/read/variables">https://launchschool.com/books/ruby/read/variables</a> (emphasis added)</sub></p>

              <p>The following statement <em><tooltip content="creates">declares</tooltip></em> a variable named <code>v</code> and <em>assigns</em> it a value <code>5</code> (the operator <code>=</code> is called the <em>assignment operator</em>):</p>

                <p><strong>Statements</strong></p>
                <p>Note that we called <code>v = 5</code> a <em>statement</em>. <strong>Unlike expressions that evaluates to a single value, a statement does not evaluates to a value.</strong> However, a statement can contain an expression e.g. <code>v = 5 + 8</code>.
                </p>
              </tip-box>
              <p>If you enter the above statement in the interactive shell, it causes the shell to remember the variable name <code>v</code> and its value.</p>
              <pre class="hljs"><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; v = 5
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
</code></pre>
              <p>Now, you can ask the shell to recall the value by simply typing in the variable name as an expression.</p>
              <pre class="hljs"><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; v
5
</code></pre>
              <p>You can even use the variable in expressions.</p>
              <pre class="hljs"><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; v * 4
20
</code></pre>
              <tip-box>
                <p>📦 Here are some examples of variables being declared, assigned, and being used:</p>
                <pre class="hljs"><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; max_bag_count = 2

                      in UML). UML is currently the <em>de facto</em> modeling notation used in the software industry.</p>

              <p><strong>A <em>function</em> is like a small program that you can execute from another program. A function has a name. Some functions take inputs</strong> (called <em>arguments</em>). The statement to <em>execute</em> (other names: <em>call</em>,

              In the example below, lines 2-4 are in the same block because they are all indented by one level; if the condition is true, all three are executed; if the condition is false, all three are omitted. Line 5 goes back to the previous indentation

                <p>Given their lightweight nature, <strong>user stories are quite handy for recording requirements during early requirements gathering</strong>.</p>
                <tip-box>
                  <p>💡 Here are some tips for using user stories for early stages of requirement gathering:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li><strong>Define the <em>target user</em>:</strong><br> Decide your target user's profile (e.g. a student, office worker, programmer, sales person) and work patterns (e.g. Does he work in groups or alone? Does he share his computer with
                      others?). A clear understanding of the target user will help when deciding the importance of a user story. You can even give this user a name. <span class="dimmed"> e.g. Target user Jean is a university student studying in a non-IT field. She interacts with a lot of people due to her involvement in university clubs/societies. ...</span></li>
                    <li><strong>Define the <em>problem scope</em>:</strong> Decide that exact problem you are going to solve for the target user. <span class="dimmed"> e.g. Help Jean keep track of all her school contacts</span></li>
                    <li><strong>Don't be too hasty to discard 'unusual' user stories:</strong><br> Those might make your product unique and stand out from the rest, at least for the target users.</li>
                    <li><strong>Don't go into too much details:</strong><br> For example, consider this user story: <code>As a user, I want to see a list of tasks that needs my attention most at the present time, so that I pay attention to them first.</code><br>                      When discussing this user story, don't worry about what tasks should be considered <em>needs my attention most at the present time</em>. Those details can be worked out later.</li>
                    <li><strong>Don't be biased by preconceived product ideas:</strong><br> When you are at the stage of identifying user needs, clear your mind of ideas you have about what your end product will look like.</li>
                    <li><strong>Don't discuss implementation details or whether you are actually going to implement it:</strong><br> When gathering requirements, your decision is whether the user's need is important enough for you to want to fulfil it. Implementation
                      details can be discussed later. If a user story turns out to be too difficult to implement later, you can always omit it from the implementation plan.</li>
                  </ul>

                <blockquote>
                  <p>One of the biggest misunderstandings with user stories is how they differ from traditional requirements specifications. The biggest difference is in the level of detail. User stories should only provide enough detail to make a reasonably
                    low risk estimate of how long the story will take to implement. When the time comes to implement the story developers will go to the customer and receive a detailed description of the requirements face to face.</p>

                            <li>Is ‘edit bug report’ a use case or editing the bug report is covered by other use cases such as those for setting the status of bug reports? If it is indeed a separate use case, who are the actors of that use case?</li>
                            <li>Does ‘assign task’ simply means ‘assign bug report’ or is there any other type of tasks?</li>
                            <li>There was some mention about Customers and Components. Does the system have to support use cases for creating and maintaining details about those entities? For example, should we have a ‘create customer record’ use case?</li>
                            <li>Which actors can perform the ‘generate report’ use case? Are reports generated automatically by the system at a specific time or generated ‘on demand’ when users request to view them? Do we have to treat different types of
                              reports as different use cases (in case some types of reports are restricted to some types of users)? The above diagram assumes (just for illustration) that the report is generated on demand and only the system admin can
                              generate any report.</li>

              <p><strong>You can use actor generalization in use case diagrams</strong> using a symbol similar to that of UML notation for inheritance.</p>
              <tip-box>
                <p>📦 In this example, actor <code>Blogger</code> can do all the use cases the actor <code>Guest</code> can do, as a result of the actor generalization relationship given in the diagram.</p><img src="/website/book/specifyingRequirements/useCases/usage/images/actorGeneralisation.png"
                  height="250"></tip-box>
              <p>💡 Do not over-complicate use case diagrams by trying to include everything possible. A use case diagram is a brief summary of the use cases that is used as a starting point. Details of the use cases can be given in the use case descriptions.</p>
              <p><strong>Some include ‘System’ as an actor to indicate that something is done by the system itself without being initiated by a user or an external system.</strong></p>
              <tip-box>
                <p>📦 The diagram below can be used to indicate that the system generates daily reports at midnight.</p><img src="/website/book/specifyingRequirements/useCases/usage/images/systemAsActor.jpg" height="200"></tip-box>
              <p>However, others argue that only use cases providing value to an external user/system should be shown in the use case diagram. For example, they argue that ‘view daily report’ should be the use case and <code>generate daily report</code>                is not to be shown in the use case diagram because it is simply something the system has to do to support the <code>view daily report</code> use case.</p>
              <p>We recommend that you follow the latter view (i.e. not to use System as a user). Limit use cases for modeling behaviors that involve an external actor.</p>
              <p><strong>UML is not very specific about the text contents of a use case.</strong> Hence, there are many styles for writing use cases. For example, the steps can be written as a continuous paragraph. Use cases should be easy to read. Note
                that there is no strict rule about writing all details of all steps or a need to use all the elements of a use case.</p>
              <p><strong>There are some advantages of documenting system requirements as use cases:</strong></p>
              <ul>
                <li>Because they use a simple notation and plain English descriptions, they are easy for users to understand and give feedback.</li>
                <li>They decouple user intention from mechanism (note that use cases should not include UI-specific details), allowing the system designers more freedom to optimize how a functionality is provided to a user.</li>
                <li>Identifying all possible extensions encourages us to consider all situations that a software product might face during its operation.</li>
                <li>Separating typical scenarios from special cases encourages us to optimize the typical scenarios.</li>
              </ul>
              <p><strong>One of the main disadvantages of use cases is that they are not good for capturing requirements that does not involve a user interacting with the system.</strong> Hence, they should not be used as the sole means to specify requirements.</p>

          <p>In addition to <em>built-in</em> functions such as <code>print()</code>, <code>input()</code>, and <code>len()</code>, <strong>Python has a set of functions called the <em>standard library</em>.</strong> Functions in the standard library are
            divided in to modules. <strong>A <em>module</em> is a python program that contains a related group of functions</strong>. You can think of it as a file containing some python functions.</p>
          <tip-box>
            <p>📦 Some example modules in the Python standard library:</p>
            <table class="markbind-table table">
              <thead>
                <tr>
                  <th>Name</th>
                  <th>What it contains</th>
                </tr>
              </thead>
              <tbody>
                <tr>
                  <td><code>math</code></td>
                  <td>mathematics-related functions</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <td><code>random</code></td>
                  <td>random number–related functions</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <td><code>sys</code></td>
                  <td>provides ways to interact with the Python interpreter</td>
                </tr>
              </tbody>
            </table>
          </tip-box>
          <p>Unlike built-in functions which you can use simply use in your code, <strong>to use a function in the standard library you need to <em>import</em> the corresponding module first.</strong></p>
          <p>Format: <code>import module_name(s)</code></p>
          <p>📦 Some examples:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><code>import math</code> (imports the <code>math</code> module)</li>
            <li><code>import math, sys, random</code> (imports all three modules in one statement)</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Furthermore, to use a function from an imported module, you should use the <code>module_name.function_name()</code> format.</p>
          <tip-box>
            <p>📦 the code below imports the <code>random</code> module and uses its <code>randint()</code> function to generate a number between 1 and 10.</p>
            <pre><code class="hljs python"><span class="hljs-keyword">import</span> random

print(<span class="hljs-string">'Going to print 5 random numbers between 1 and 10'</span>)

        <div>
          <h3 id="local-and-global-scope">Local and Global Scope</h3>
          <p><strong>The <em>scope</em> of a variable is which part of the code it can be read/modified.</strong> Think of a scope as a container for variables. When a scope is destroyed, all the values stored in the scope’s variables are forgotten.</p>
          <p><strong>The <em>global scope</em> is the scope that is applicable to the entire program.</strong> There is only one global scope, and it is created when your program begins. When your program terminates, the global scope is destroyed, and all
            its variables are forgotten. Otherwise, the next time you ran your program, the variables would remember their values from the last time you ran it. <strong>A variable that exists in the global scope is called a <em>global variable</em>.</strong></p>
          <p><strong>A <em>local scope</em> is a scope that applies only during the execution of a function.</strong> A local scope is created whenever a function is called. Parameters and variables that are assigned in the called function are said to exist
            in that function’s local scope. <strong>A variable that exists in a local scope is called a <em>local variable</em>.</strong> When the function returns, the local scope is destroyed, and these variables are forgotten. The next time you call
            this function, the local variables will not remember the values stored in them from the last time the function was called.</p>
          <p>A variable must be in the global scope or the local scope; it cannot be in both.</p>
          <p><sub><span class="dimmed">[Some parts of the above explanation were adapted from <a href="https://automatetheboringstuff.com/chapter3/"><em>Automate the Boring Stuff</em></a>]</span></sub></p>
          <p>Consider the code given below, apparently from a program related to a farm, with the global scope and the local scope of each function indicated by shaded areas.<br><img src="/website/programming/functions-scope/images/scopeAsShadedAreas.png"
              width="500"></p>
          <p>Note the following rules about scope:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Rule 1: <strong>Local scopes can read global variables</strong> e.g., <code>raise_chicken</code> function can access the global variable <code>total_chickens</code> (see line 6).</li>
            <li>Rule 2: <strong>Global scope cannot read/write local variables</strong> e.g., line 11 will be rejected because it reads the local variable <code>eggs</code>.</li>
            <li>Rule 3: <strong>Local scopes cannot read/write variables of other local scopes</strong> e.g., line 15 will be rejected because it reads the local variable <code>eggs</code>.</li>
            <li>Rule 4: <strong>If a variable is <mark><em>assigned</em></mark> in a local scope, it becomes a local variable</strong> even if a global variable has the same name. That is, there can be separate global and local variables with the same name.
              e.g., line 16 (<code>total_cows = 10</code>) creates a local variable <code>total_cows</code> although there is also a global variable <code>total_cows</code>; the line 19 prints <code>5</code> because the <code>total_cows</code> global
              variable remains <code>5</code> and the local variable <code>total_cows</code> which has the value <code>10</code> is destroyed after the function <code>milk_cows</code> is executed.</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>To modify a global variable within a local scope, use the <code>global</code> statement on that variable.</strong></p>
          <tip-box>
            <p>📦 The <code>breed_cows</code> function below can increase the global variable <code>total_cows</code> to <code>10</code> from the local scope because it has a <code>global total_cows</code> statement. If you remove that statement, the last
              print statement will print <code>5</code> instead of <code>10</code></p>
