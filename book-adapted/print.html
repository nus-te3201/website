        <p>The following description of the <em>Joys of the Programming Craft</em> was taken from Chapter 1 of the famous book
          <trigger for="modal:mmm" trigger="click"><em>The Mythical Man-Month</em>, by Frederick P. Brooks</trigger>.</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><strong>Why is programming fun? What delights may its practitioner expect as his reward?</strong></p>
          <p>First is the sheer joy of making things. As the child delights in his mud pie, so the adult enjoys building things, especially things of his own design. I think this delight must be an image of God's delight in making things, a delight shown
            in the distinctness and newness of each leaf and each snowflake.</p>
          <p>Second is the pleasure of making things that are useful to other people. Deep within, we want others to use our work and to find it helpful. In this respect the programming system is not essentially different from the child's first clay pencil
            holder &quot;for Daddy's office.&quot;</p>
          <p>Third is the fascination of fashioning complex puzzle-like objects of interlocking moving parts and watching them work in subtle cycles, playing out the consequences of principles built in from the beginning. The programmed computer has all
            the fascination of the pinball machine or the jukebox mechanism, carried to the ultimate.</p>
          <p>Fourth is the joy of always learning, which springs from the nonrepeating nature of the task. In one way or another the problem is ever new, and its solver learns something: sometimes practical, sometimes theoretical, and sometimes both.</p>
          <p>Finally, there is the delight of working in such a tractable medium. The programmer, like the poet, works only slightly removed from pure thought-stuff. He builds his castles in the air, from air, creating by the exertion of the imagination.
            Few media of creation are so flexible, so easy to polish and rework, so readily capable of realizing grand conceptual structures....</p>
          <p>Yet the program construct, unlike the poet's words, is real in the sense that it moves and works, producing visible outputs separate from the construct itself. It prints results, draws pictures, produces sounds, moves arms. The magic of myth
            and legend has come true in our time. One types the correct incantation on a keyboard, and a display screen comes to life, showing things that never were nor could be.</p>
          <p>Programming then is fun because it gratifies creative longings built deep within us and delights sensibilities we have in common with all men.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p><strong>Not all is delight, however, and knowing the inherent woes makes it easier to bear them when they appear.</strong></p>
          <p>First, one must perform perfectly. The computer resembles the magic of legend in this respect, too. If one character, one pause, of the incantation is not strictly in proper form, the magic doesn't work. Human beings are not accustomed to being
            perfect, and few areas of human activity demand it. Adjusting to the requirement for perfection is, I think, the most difficult part of learning to program.</p>
          <p>Next, other people set one's objectives, provide one's resources, and furnish one's information. One rarely controls the circumstances of his work, or even its goal. In management terms, one's authority is not sufficient for his responsibility.
            It seems that in all fields, however, the jobs where things get done never have formal authority commensurate with responsibility. In practice, actual (as opposed to formal) authority is acquired from the very momentum of accomplishment.</p>
          <p>The dependence upon others has a particular case that is especially painful for the system programmer. He depends upon other people's programs. These are often maldesigned, poorly implemented, incompletely delivered (no source code or test cases),
            and poorly documented. So he must spend hours studying and fixing things that in an ideal world would be complete, available, and usable.</p>
          <p>The next woe is that designing grand concepts is fun; finding nitty little bugs is just work. With any creative activity come dreary hours of tedious, painstaking labor, and programming is no exception.</p>
          <p>Next, one finds that debugging has a linear convergence, or worse, where one somehow expects a quadratic sort of approach to the end. So testing drags on and on, the last difficult bugs taking more time to find than the first.</p>
          <p>The last woe, and sometimes the last straw, is that the product over which one has labored so long appears to be obsolete upon (or before) completion. Already colleagues and competitors are in hot pursuit of new and better ideas. Already the
            displacement of one's thought-child is not only conceived, but scheduled.</p>
          <p>This always seems worse than it really is. The new and better product is generally not available when one completes his own; it is only talked about. It, too, will require months of development. The real tiger is never a match for the paper
            one, unless actual use is wanted. Then the virtues of reality have a satisfaction all their own.</p>
          <p>Of course the technological base on which one builds is always advancing. As soon as one freezes a design, it becomes obsolete in terms of its concepts. But implementation of real products demands phasing and quantizing. The obsolescence of
            an implementation must be measured against other existing implementations, not against unrealized concepts. The challenge and the mission are to find real solutions to real problems on actual schedules with available resources.</p>
          <p>This then is programming, both a tar pit in which many efforts have floundered and a creative activity with joys and woes all its own. For many, the joys far outweigh the woes....</p>

          <p><strong>A <em>software requirement</em> specifies a need to be fulfilled by the software product.</strong></p>
          <p>A software project may be,</p>
          <ul>
            <li>a <em>brown-field</em> project i.e., develop a product to replace/update an existing software product</li>
            <li>a <em>green-field</em> project i.e., develop a totally new system with no precedent</li>
          </ul>
          <p>In either case, requirements need to be gathered, analyzed, specified, and managed.</p>
          <p><strong>Requirements come from <em>stakeholders</em>.</strong></p>

                <li>Technical requirements: e.g. the system should work on both 32-bit and 64-bit environments.</li>
                <li>Performance requirements: e.g. the system should respond within two seconds.</li>
                <li>Quality requirements: e.g. the system should be usable by a novice who has never carried out an online purchase.</li>
                <li>Process requirements: e.g. the project is expected to adhere to a schedule that delivers a feature set every one month.</li>
                <li>Notes about project scope: e.g. the product is not required to handle the printing of reports.</li>
                <li>Any other noteworthy points: e.g. the game should not use images deemed offensive to those injured in real mine clearing activities.

            <p>Given their lightweight nature, <strong>user stories are quite handy for recording requirements during early requirements gathering</strong>.</p>
            <tip-box>
              <p>💡 Here are some tips for using user stories for early stages of requirement gathering:</p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Define the <em>target user</em>:</strong><br> Decide your target user's profile (e.g. a student, office worker, programmer, sales person) and work patterns (e.g. Does he work in groups or alone? Does he share his computer with
                  others?). A clear understanding of the target user will help when deciding the importance of a user story. You can even give this user a name. <span class="dimmed"> e.g. Target user Jean is a university student studying in a non-IT field. She interacts with a lot of people due to her involvement in university clubs/societies. ...</span></li>
                <li><strong>Define the <em>problem scope</em>:</strong> Decide that exact problem you are going to solve for the target user. <span class="dimmed"> e.g. Help Jean keep track of all her school contacts</span></li>
                <li><strong>Don't be too hasty to discard 'unusual' user stories:</strong><br> Those might make your product unique and stand out from the rest, at least for the target users.</li>
                <li><strong>Don't go into too much details:</strong><br> For example, consider this user story: <code>As a user, I want to see a list of tasks that needs my attention most at the present time, so that I pay attention to them first.</code><br>                  When discussing this user story, don't worry about what tasks should be considered <em>needs my attention most at the present time</em>. Those details can be worked out later.</li>
                <li><strong>Don't be biased by preconceived product ideas:</strong><br> When you are at the stage of identifying user needs, clear your mind of ideas you have about what your end product will look like.</li>
                <li><strong>Don't discuss implementation details or whether you are actually going to implement it:</strong><br> When gathering requirements, your decision is whether the user's need is important enough for you to want to fulfil it. Implementation
                  details can be discussed later. If a user story turns out to be too difficult to implement later, you can always omit it from the implementation plan.</li>
              </ul>

            <blockquote>
              <p>One of the biggest misunderstandings with user stories is how they differ from traditional requirements specifications. The biggest difference is in the level of detail. User stories should only provide enough detail to make a reasonably
                low risk estimate of how long the story will take to implement. When the time comes to implement the story developers will go to the customer and receive a detailed description of the requirements face to face.</p>

              <li>either of the extensions marked <code>3a.</code> and <code>3b.</code> can happen just after step <code>3</code> of the MSS.</li>

            </ul>
            <p>When separating extensions from the MSS, keep in mind that the <strong>MSS should be self-contained</strong>. That is, the MSS should give us a complete usage scenario.</p>
            <p>Also note that it is not useful to mention events such as power failures or system crashes as extensions because the system cannot function beyond such catastrophic failures.</p>

          <p><strong>You can use actor generalization in use case diagrams</strong> using a symbol similar to that of UML notation for inheritance.</p>
          <tip-box>
            <p>📦 In this example, actor <code>Blogger</code> can do all the use cases the actor <code>Guest</code> can do, as a result of the actor generalization relationship given in the diagram.</p>
            <img src="/website/book/specifyingRequirements/useCases/usage/images/actorGeneralisation.png" height="250"></tip-box>
          <p>💡 Do not over-complicate use case diagrams by trying to include everything possible. A use case diagram is a brief summary of the use cases that is used as a starting point. Details of the use cases can be given in the use case descriptions.</p>
          <p><strong>Some include ‘System’ as an actor to indicate that something is done by the system itself without being initiated by a user or an external system.</strong></p>
          <tip-box>
            <p>📦 The diagram below can be used to indicate that the system generates daily reports at midnight.</p>
            <img src="/website/book/specifyingRequirements/useCases/usage/images/systemAsActor.jpg" height="200"></tip-box>
          <p>However, others argue that only use cases providing value to an external user/system should be shown in the use case diagram. For example, they argue that ‘view daily report’ should be the use case and <code>generate daily report</code> is not
            to be shown in the use case diagram because it is simply something the system has to do to support the <code>view daily report</code> use case.</p>
          <p>We recommend that you follow the latter view (i.e. not to use System as a user). Limit use cases for modeling behaviors that involve an external actor.</p>
          <p><strong>UML is not very specific about the text contents of a use case.</strong> Hence, there are many styles for writing use cases. For example, the steps can be written as a continuous paragraph. Use cases should be easy to read. Note that
            there is no strict rule about writing all details of all steps or a need to use all the elements of a use case.</p>
          <p><strong>There are some advantages of documenting system requirements as use cases:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Because they use a simple notation and plain English descriptions, they are easy for users to understand and give feedback.</li>
            <li>They decouple user intention from mechanism (note that use cases should not include UI-specific details), allowing the system designers more freedom to optimize how a functionality is provided to a user.</li>
            <li>Identifying all possible extensions encourages us to consider all situations that a software product might face during its operation.</li>
            <li>Separating typical scenarios from special cases encourages us to optimize the typical scenarios.</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>One of the main disadvantages of use cases is that they are not good for capturing requirements that does not involve a user interacting with the system.</strong> Hence, they should not be used as the sole means to specify requirements.</p>

          <p><strong>Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a <em>programming paradigm</em>.</strong> A programming paradigm guides programmers to analyze programming problems, and structure programming solutions, in a specific way.</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>Programming languages have traditionally divided the world into two parts—data and operations on data. Data is static and immutable, except as the operations may change it. The procedures and functions that operate on data have no lasting
              state of their own; they’re useful only in their ability to affect data.</p>
            <p>This division is, of course, grounded in the way computers work, so it’s not one that you can easily ignore or push aside. Like the equally pervasive distinctions between matter and energy and between nouns and verbs, it forms the background
              against which we work. At some point, all programmers—even object-oriented programmers—must lay out the data structures that their programs will use and define the functions that will act on the data.</p>
            <p>With a procedural programming language like C, that’s about all there is to it. The language may offer various kinds of support for organizing data and functions, but it won’t divide the world any differently. Functions and data structures
              are the basic elements of design.</p>
            <p>Object-oriented programming doesn’t so much dispute this view of the world as restructure it at a higher level. It groups operations and data into modular units called objects and lets you combine objects into structured networks to form a
              complete program. In an object-oriented programming language, objects and object interactions are the basic elements of design.</p>

        <div>
          <blockquote>
            <p>Every object has both state (data) and behavior (operations on data). In that, they’re not much different from ordinary physical objects. It’s easy to see how a mechanical device, such as a pocket watch or a piano, embodies both state and
              behavior. But almost anything that’s designed to do a job does, too. Even simple things with no moving parts such as an ordinary bottle combine state (how full the bottle is, whether or not it’s open, how warm its contents are) with behavior
              (the ability to dispense its contents at various flow rates, to be opened or closed, to withstand high or low temperatures).</p>
            <p>It’s this resemblance to real things that gives objects much of their power and appeal. They can not only model components of real systems, but equally as well fulfill assigned roles as components in software systems.</p>

          <p><strong>Object Oriented Programming (OOP) views the world as <em>a network of interacting objects</em>.</strong></p>
          <tip-box>
            <p>📦 A real world scenario viewed as a network of interacting objects:</p>
            <p>You are asked to find out the average age of a group of people Adam, Beth, Charlie, and Daisy. You take a piece of paper and pen, go to each person, ask for their age, and note it down. After collecting the age of all four, you enter it into
              a calculator to find the total. And then, use the same calculator to divide the total by four, to get the average age. This can be viewed as the objects <code>You</code>, <code>Pen</code>, <code>Paper</code>, <code>Calculator</code>, <code>Adam</code>,
              <code>Beth</code>, <code>Charlie</code>, and <code>Daisy</code> interacting to accomplish to achieve the end result of calculating the average age of the four persons. These objects can be considered as connected in a certain network of
              certain structure.</p>
          </tip-box>
          <p><strong>OOP solutions try to create a similar object network inside the computer’s memory</strong> – a sort of a virtual simulation of the corresponding real world scenario – <strong>so that a similar result can be achieved programmatically.</strong></p>

          <p><strong>OOP does not demand that the virtual world object network follow the real world <em>exactly</em>.</strong></p>
          <tip-box>
            <p>📦 Our previous example can be tweaked a bit as follows:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Use an object called <code>Main</code> to represent your role in the scenario.</li>
              <li>As there is no physical writing involved, we can replace the <code>Pen</code> and <code>Paper</code> with an object called <code>AgeList</code> that is able to keep a list of ages.</li>
            </ul>

          <p>The concept of <strong><em>Objects</em> in OOP is an abstraction mechanism because it allows us to abstract away the lower level details and work with bigger granularity entities</strong> i.e. ignore details data formats and the method implementation
            details and work at the level of objects.</p>
          <tip-box>
            <p>📦 We can deal with a <code>Person</code> object that represents the person Adam and query the object for Adam's age instead of dealing with details such as Adam’s date of birth (DoB), in what format the DoB is stored, the algorithm used to
              calculate the age from the DoB, etc.</p>

          <p><strong>An object is an <em>encapsulation</em> of some data and related behavior in two aspects:</strong></p>
          <p><strong>1. The <em>packaging</em> aspect:</strong> An object packages data and related behavior together into one self-contained unit.</p>
          <p><strong>2. The <em>information hiding</em> aspect:</strong> The data in an object is hidden from the outside world and are only accessible using the object's interface.</p>

          <p><strong>Writing an OOP program is essentially writing instructions that the computer uses to,</strong></p>

            <li><strong>create the virtual world of object network, and</strong></li>
            <li><strong>provide it the inputs to produce the outcome we want.</strong></li>
          </ol>
          <p><strong>A <mark><em>class</em></mark> contains instructions for creating a specific kind of objects</strong>. It turns out sometimes multiple objects have the same behavior because they are of the same kind. Instructions for creating a one kind
            (or ‘class’) of objects can be done in one go and use that same instructions to instantiate (i.e. create) objects of that kind. We call such instructions a <em>Class</em>.</p>
          <tip-box>
            <p>📦 Classes and objects in an example scenario</p>
            <p>When writing an OOP program to calculate the average age of Adam, Beth, Charlie, and Daisy, instructions for creating objects <code>Adam</code>, <code>Beth</code>, <code>Charlie</code>, and <code>Daisy</code> will be very similar because they
              are all of the same kind : they all represent ‘persons’ with the same interface, the same kind of data (i.e. <code>name</code>, <code>DoB</code>, etc.), and the same kind of behavior (i.e. <code>getAge(Date)</code>, <code>getName()</code>,
              etc.). Therefore, we can have a class called <code>Person</code> containing instructions on how to create <code>Person</code> objects and use that class to instantiate objects <code>Adam</code>, <code>Beth</code>, <code>Charlie</code>, and
              <code>Daisy</code>. Similarly, we need classes <code>AgeList</code>, <code>Calculator</code>, and <code>Main</code> classes to instantiate one each of <code>AgeList</code>, <code>Calculator</code>, and <code>Main</code> objects.</p>

          <p>While all objects of a class has the same attributes, each object has its own copy of the attribute value.</p>
          <tip-box>
            <p>📦 All <code>Person</code> objects have the <code>Name</code> attribute but the value of that attribute varies between <code>Person</code> objects.</p>
          </tip-box>
          <p>However, some attributes are not suitable to be maintained by individual objects. Instead, they should be maintained centrally, shared by all objects of the class. They are like ‘global variables’ but attached to a specific class. Such <strong>variables whose value is shared by all instances of a class are called <mark><em>class level attributes</em></mark></strong>.</p>
          <tip-box>

          <p>Similarly, when a normal method is being called, a message is being sent to the receiving object and the result may depend on the receiving object.</p>
          <tip-box>
            <p>📦 Sending the <code>getName()</code> message to <code>Adam</code> object results in the response <code>&quot;Adam&quot;</code> while sending the same message to the <code>Beth</code> object gets the response <code>&quot;Beth&quot;</code>.</p>
          </tip-box>
          <p>However, there can be methods related to a specific class but not suitable for sending message to a specific object of that class. Such <strong>methods that are called using the class instead of a specific instance are called <mark><em>class-level methods</em></mark></strong>.</p>
          <tip-box>
            <p>📦 The method <code>getTotalPersons()</code> is not suitable to send to a specific <code>Person</code> object <span class="dimmed">because a specific object of the <code>Person</code> class should not know about the total number of <code>Person</code> objects</span>.</p>

However, the two classes cannot be simply replaced with a more general class <code>Person</code> because of the need to distinguish between <code>Man</code>              and <code>Woman</code> for the ‘marriage’ association. A solution is to add the <code>Person</code> class as a super class and let <code>Man</code> and <code>Woman</code> inherit from <code>Person</code>.</p>

            <p>Inheritance does not necessarily mean a sub-type relationship exists. However, the two often go hand-in-hand. For simplicity, at this point let us assume inheritance implies a sub-type relationship.</p>

        <p><strong>In software development, models are useful in several ways:</strong></p>
        <p>a) <strong>To analyze a complex entity related to software development.</strong></p>

          <ol>
            <li>Models of the problem domain (i.e. the environment in which the software is expected to solve a problem) can be built to aid the understanding of the problem to be solved.</li>
            <li>When planning a software solution, models can be created to figure out how the solution is to be built. An architecture diagram is such a model.</li>
          </ol>

        <p>b) <strong>To communicate information among stakeholders.</strong> Models can be used as a visual aid in discussions and documentations.</p>

            <li>A business analyst can use a use case diagram to explain to the customer the functionality of the system.</li>
            <li>A class diagram can be reverse-engineered from code so as to help explain the design of a component to a new developer.</li>
          </ol>

          <ol>
            <li>A senior developer draws a class diagram to propose a design for an OOP software and passes it to a junior programmer to implement.</li>

            <p><strong><em>Model-driven development (MDD)</em>, also called <em>Model-driven engineering</em>, is an approach to software development that strives to exploits models as blueprints.</strong> MDD uses models as primary engineering artifacts
              when developing software. That is, the system is first created in the form of models. After that, the models are converted to code using code-generation techniques (usually, automated or semi-automated, but can even involve manual translation
              from model to code). MDD requires the use of a very expressive modeling notation (graphical or otherwise), often specific to a given problem domain. It also requires sophisticated tools to generate code from models and maintain the link
              between models and the code. One advantage of MDD is that the same model can be used to create software for different platforms and different languages. MDD has a lot of promise, but it is still an emerging technology</p>

          <p><strong>Exception objects can propagate up the function call hierarchy until it is dealt with.</strong> Usually, an exception thrown by a function is caught by the caller function. If the called function does not know how to deal with the exception
            it caught, it can throw/raise the Exception object to its own caller. If none of the callers is prepared to deal with the exception, the exceptions can propagate through the
            <tooltip content="the hieararchy of function calls">function call stack</tooltip> until it is received by the main function and thrown to the runtime, thus halting the system.</p>

          <p><strong>Professional software engineers often write code using <em>Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)</em>. IDEs support all development-related work within the same tool.</strong></p>
          <p>An IDE generally consists of:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>A source code editor that includes features such as syntax coloring, auto-completion, easy code navigation, error highlighting, and code-snippet generation.</li>
            <li>A compiler and/or an interpreter (together with other build automation support) that facilitates the compilation/linking/running/deployment of a program.</li>
            <li>A debugger that allows the developer to execute the program one step at a time to observe the run-time behavior in order to locate bugs.</li>
            <li>Other tools that aid various aspects of coding e.g. support for automated testing, drag-and-drop construction of UI components, version management support, simulation of the target runtime platform, and modeling support.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Examples of popular IDEs:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Java: Eclipse, Intellij IDEA, NetBeans</li>
            <li>C#, C++: Visual Studio</li>
            <li>Swift: XCode</li>
            <li>Python: PyCharm</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Some Web-based IDEs have appeared in recent times too e.g., Amazon's <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloud9/">Cloud9 IDE</a>.</p>
          <p>Some experienced developers, in particular those with a UNIX background, prefer lightweight yet powerful text editors with scripting capabilities (e.g. <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">Emacs</a>) over heavier IDEs.</p>

          <p><strong><em>Debugging</em> is the process of discovering defects in the program.</strong> Here are some approaches to debugging:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>👎 <strong>By inserting temporary print statements</strong>: This is an ad-hoc approach in which print statements are inserted in the program to print information relevant to debugging, such as variable values. e.g. <code>Exiting process() method, x is 5.347</code>.
                This approach is not recommended due to these reasons.</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Incurs extra effort when inserting and removing the print statements.</li>
                <li>Unnecessary program modifications increases the risk of introducing errors into the program.</li>
                <li>These print statements, if not promptly removed, may even appear unexpectedly in the production version.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>👎 <strong>By manually tracing through the code</strong>: Otherwise known as ‘eye-balling’, this approach doesn't have the cons of the previous approach, but it too is not recommended (other than as a 'quick try') due to these reasons:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>It is difficult, time consuming, and error-prone technique.</li>
                <li>If you didn't spot the error while writing code, you might not spot the error when reading code too.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>👍 <strong>Using a debugger</strong>: A debugger tool allows you to pause the execution, then step through one statement at a time while examining the internal state if necessary. Most IDEs come with an inbuilt debugger. <strong>This is the recommended approach for debugging</strong>.</p>

          <p><strong>Among various dimensions of code quality, such as run-time efficiency, security, and robustness, one of the most important is understandability.</strong> This is because in any non-trivial software project, code needs to be read, understood,
            and modified by other developers later on. Even if we do not intend to pass the code to someone else, code quality is still important because we all become 'strangers' to our own code someday.</p>

          <p><strong>One essential way to improve code quality is to follow a consistent style. That is why software engineers follow a strict coding standard (aka <em>style guide</em>).</strong></p>
          <p><strong>The aim of a coding standard is to make the entire code base look like it was written by one person</strong>. A coding standard is usually specific to a programming language and specifies guidelines such as the location of opening and
            closing braces, indentation styles and naming styles (e.g. whether to use Hungarian style, Pascal casing, Camel casing, etc.). It is important that the whole team/company use the same coding standard and that standard is not generally inconsistent
            with typical industry practices. <span class="dimmed">If a company's coding standards is very different from what is used typically in the industry, new recruits will take longer to get used to the company's coding style.</span></p>

          <p>The first version of the code you write may not be of production quality. It is OK to first concentrate on making the code work, rather than worry over the quality of the code, as long as you improve the quality later. This process of <strong>improving a program's internal structure in small steps without modifying its external behavior is called <em>refactoring</em>.</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Refactoring is not rewriting</strong>: Discarding poorly-written code entirely and re-writing it from scratch is not refactoring because refactoring needs to be done in small steps.</li>
            <li><strong>Refactoring is not bug fixing</strong>: By definition, refactoring is different from bug fixing or any other modifications that alter the external behavior (e.g. adding a feature) of the component in concern.</li>
          </ul>
          <tip-box>
            <p>💡 Improving code structure can have many secondary benefits: e.g.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>hidden bugs become easier to spot</li>
              <li>improve performance (sometimes, simpler code runs faster than complex code because simpler code is easier for the compiler to optimize).</li>

        <p>Reuse is a major theme in software engineering practices. <strong>By reusing tried-and-tested components, the robustness of a new software system can be enhanced while reducing the manpower and time requirement.</strong> Reusable components come

        <p>While you may be tempted to use many libraries/frameworks/platform that seem to crop up on a regular basis and promise to bring great benefits, note that <strong>there are costs associated with reuse</strong>. Here are some:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The reused code <strong>may be an overkill</strong> (think <em>using a sledgehammer to crack a nut</em>) increasing the size of, or/and degrading the performance of, your software.</li>
          <li>The reused software <strong>may not be mature/stable enough</strong> to be used in an important product. That means the software can change drastically and rapidly, possibly in ways that break your software.</li>
          <li>Non-mature software has the <strong>risk of dying off</strong> as fast as they emerged, leaving you with a dependency that is no longer maintained.</li>
          <li>The license of the reused software (or its dependencies) <strong>restrict how you can use/develop your software</strong>.</li>
          <li>The reused software <strong>might have bugs, missing features, or security vulnerabilities</strong> that are important to your product but not so important to the maintainers of that software, which means those flaws will not get fixed as fast
            as you need them to.</li>

        <p><strong>A <em>platform</em> provides a runtime environment for applications.</strong> A platform is often bundled with various libraries, tools, frameworks, and technologies in addition to a runtime environment but the defining characteristic
          of a software platform is the presence of a runtime environment.</p>
        <tip-box>
          <p>📦 Technically, an operating system can be called a platform. For example, Windows PC is a platform for desktop applications while iOS is a platform for mobile apps.</p>
        </tip-box>
        <tip-box>
          <p>📦 <strong>Two well-known examples of platforms are JavaEE and .NET</strong>, both of which sit above Operating systems layer, and are used to develop
            <trigger for="modal:enterprise-application" trigger="click">enterprise applications</trigger>. Infrastructure services such as connection pooling, load balancing, remote code execution, transaction management, authentication, security, messaging etc. are done similarly in most enterprise applications.
            Both JavaEE and .NET provide these services to applications in a customizable way without developers having to implement them from scratch every time.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>JavaEE (Java Enterprise Edition) is both a framework and a platform for writing enterprise applications. The runtime used by the JavaEE applications is the JVM (Java Virtual Machine) that can run on different Operating Systems.</li>
            <li>.NET is a similar platform and a framework. Its runtime is called CLR (Common Language Runtime) and usually used on Windows machines.</li>

        <p><strong>Cloud computing is the delivery of computing as a service over the network</strong>, rather than a product running on a local machine. This means the actual hardware and software is located at a remote location, typically, at a large server
          farm, while users access them over the network. Maintenance of the hardware and software is managed by the cloud provider while users typically pay for only the amount of services they use. This model is similar to the consumption of electricity;
          the power company manages the power plant, while the consumers pay them only for the electricity used. The cloud computing model optimizes hardware and software utilization and reduces the cost to consumers. Furthermore, users can scale up/down
          their utilization at will without having to upgrade their hardware and software. The traditional non-cloud model of computing is similar to everyone buying their own generators to create electricity for their own use.</p>

        <p>Cloud computing can deliver computing services at three levels:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Infrastructure as a service (IaaS) delivers computer infrastructure as a service.</strong> For example, a user can deploy virtual servers on the cloud instead of buying physical hardware and installing server software on them. Another
              example would be a customer using storage space on the cloud for off-site storage of data. <span class="dimmed"> Rackspace is an example of an IaaS cloud provider. Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) is another one.</span></p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Platform as a service (PaaS) provides a platform on which developers can build applications.</strong> Developers do not have to worry about infrastructure issues such as deploying servers or load balancing as is required when using
              IaaS. Those aspects are automatically taken care of by the platform. The price to pay is reduced flexibility; applications written on PaaS are limited to facilities provided by the platform. <span class="dimmed"> A PaaS example is the Google App Engine where developers can build applications using Java, Python, PHP, or Go whereas Amazon EC2 allows users to deploy application written in any language on their virtual servers.</span></p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Software as a service (SaaS) allows applications to be accessed over the network</strong> instead of installing them on a local machine. <span class="dimmed"> For example, Google Docs is an SaaS word processing software, while Microsoft Word is a traditional word processing software.</span></p>

        <p>Here are some tips on writing effective documentation.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Use plenty of diagrams</strong>: It is not enough to explain something in words; complement it with visual illustrations (e.g. a UML diagram).</li>
          <li><strong>Use plenty of examples</strong>: When explaining algorithms, show a running example to illustrate each step of the algorithm, in parallel to worded explanations.</li>
          <li><strong>Use simple and direct explanations</strong>: Convoluted explanations and fancy words will annoy readers. Avoid long sentences.</li>
          <li><strong>Get rid of statements that do not add value</strong>: For example, 'We made sure our system works perfectly' (who didn't?), 'Component X has its own responsibilities' (of course it has!).</li>
          <li><strong>It is not a good idea to have separate sections for each type of artifact</strong>, such as 'use cases', 'sequence diagrams', 'activity diagrams', etc. Such a structure, coupled with the indiscriminate inclusion of diagrams without justifying
            their need, indicates a failure to understand the purpose of documentation. Include diagrams when they are needed to explain something. If you want to provide additional diagrams for completeness' sake, include them in the appendix as a reference.</li>

          <p><strong>When testing, we execute a set of <em>test cases</em>.</strong> A test case specifies how to perform a test. At a minimum, it specifies the input to the <em>software under test (SUT)</em> and the expected behavior.</p>
          <tip-box>
            <p>📦 Example: A minimal test case for testing a browser:</p>
            <ul>

          <p><strong>A simple way to semi-automate testing of a CLI(Command Line Interface) app is by using input/output re-direction.</strong></p>
          <ul>

          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>Store the test input in the text file <code>input.txt</code>.</p>

            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Store the output we expect from the SUT in another text file <code>expected.txt</code>.</p>
              <panel header="%%:package: Example `expected.txt`%%" type="seamless">
                <pre class="hljs"><code>Command: || [add Valid Name p/12345 valid@email.butNoPrefix]

            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Run the program as given below, which will redirect the text in <code>input.txt</code> as the input to <code>AddressBook</code> and similarly, will redirect the output of AddressBook to a text file <code>output.txt</code>. <span class="dimmed">Note that this does not require any code changes to <code>AddressBook</code>.</span></p>
              <pre><code class="hljs sh">java AddressBook &lt; input.txt &gt; output.txt

                <li>
                  <p>💡 The way to run a CLI program differs based on the language.<br> e.g., In Python, assuming the code is in <code>AddressBook.py</code> file, use the command<br>
                    <code>python AddressBook.py &lt; input.txt &gt; output.txt</code></p>
                </li>
                <li>

                <p>A CLI program takes input from the keyboard and outputs to the console. That is because those two are default input and output streams, respectively. But you can change that behavior using <code>&lt;</code> and <code>&gt;</code> operators.
                  For example, if you run <code>AddressBook</code> in a command window, the output will be shown in the console, but if you run it like this,</p>
                <pre><code class="hljs sh">java AddressBook &gt; output.txt 
</code></pre>
                <p>the Operating System then creates a file <code>output.txt</code> and stores the output in that file instead of displaying it in the console. No file I/O coding is required. Similarly, adding <code>&lt; input.txt</code> (or any other filename)
                  makes the OS redirect the contents of the file as input to the program, as if the user typed the content of the file one line at a time.</p>

        <p>System testing is typically done by a testing team (also called a QA team).</p>
        <p><strong>System test cases are based on the specified external behavior of the system.</strong> Sometimes, system tests go beyond the bounds defined in the specification. This is useful when testing that the system fails 'gracefully' having pushed
          beyond its limits.</p>
        <tip-box>
          <p>📦 Suppose the SUT is a browser capable of handling web pages containing up to 5000 characters. Given below is a test case to test if the SUT fails gracefully if pushed beyond its limits.</p>
          <pre class="hljs"><code>Test case: load a web page that is too big
* Input: load a web page containing more than 5000 characters. 
* Expected behavior: abort the loading of the page and show a meaningful error message.

          <p>This test case would fail if the browser attempted to load the large file anyway and crashed.</p>

          <li><em>Security testing</em> – to test how secure the system is.</li>
          <li><em>Compatibility testing, interoperability testing</em> – to check whether the system can work with other systems.</li>

          <li><strong>Locating the cause of such a test case failure is difficult due to a large search space;</strong> in a large system, the search space could be millions of lines of code, written by hundreds of developers! The failure may also be due
            to multiple inter-related bugs.</li>
          <li><strong>Fixing a bug found during such testing could result in major rework</strong>, especially if the bug originated during the design or during requirements specification (i.e. a faulty design or faulty requirements).</li>
          <li><strong>One bug might 'hide' other bugs</strong>, which could emerge only after the first bug is fixed.</li>
          <li><strong>The delivery may have to be delayed</strong> if too many bugs were found during testing.</li>

          <trigger trigger="click" for="modal:exploratoryWhat-bach-et-explained">[source: bach-et-explained]</trigger> whereby the nature of the follow-up test case is decided based on the behavior of the previous test cases. In other words, running the system and trying out various operations. It is called <em>exploratory testing</em>          because testing is driven by observations during testing. Exploratory testing usually starts with areas identified as error-prone, based on the tester’s past experience with similar systems. One tends to conduct more tests for those operations

              even if x doesn’t work. Now, if feature y doesn’t work 100%, we have a major problem and this has to be made known to the development team sooner rather than later...”</p>

        <p>Which approach is better – <strong>scripted or exploratory? A mix is better.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>The success of exploratory testing depends on the tester’s prior experience and intuition.</strong> Exploratory testing should be done by experienced testers, using a clear strategy/plan/framework. Ad-hoc exploratory testing by unskilled
          or inexperienced testers without a clear strategy is not recommended for real-world non-trivial systems. While <strong>exploratory testing may allow us to detect some problems in a relatively short time, it is not prudent to use exploratory testing as the sole means of testing a critical system</strong>.</p>
        <p><strong>Scripted testing is more systematic, and hence, likely to discover more bugs given sufficient time</strong>, while exploratory testing would aid in quick error discovery, especially if the tester has a lot of experience in testing similar

          <li>

          <div id="isValidMonth">

        <p>It is inefficient and impractical to test this method for all integer values <code>[-MIN_INT to MAX_INT]</code>. Fortunately, there is no need to test all possible input values. For example, if the input value <code>233</code> failed to produce
          the correct result, the input <code>234</code> is likely to fail too; there is no need to test both.</p>
        <p>In general, <strong>most SUTs do not treat each input in a unique way. Instead, they process all possible inputs in a small number of distinct ways.</strong> That means a range of inputs is treated the same way inside the SUT.
          <strong><em>Equivalence partitioning (EP)</em> is a test case design technique that uses the above observation to improve the E&amp;E of testing.</strong></p>

          </ul>
        </tip-box>
        <p>Some inputs have only a small number of possible values and a potentially unique behavior for each value. In those cases we have to consider each value as a partition by itself.</p>
        <tip-box>
          <p>📦 Consider the method <code>showStatusMessage(GameStatus s):String</code> that returns a unique <code>String</code> for each of the possible value of s (<code>GameStatus</code> is an <code>enum</code>). In this case, each possible value for
            <code>s</code> will have to be considered as a partition.</p>
        </tip-box>
        <p>Note that the EP technique is merely a heuristic and not an exact science, especially when applied manually (as opposed to using an automated program analysis tool to derive EPs). The partitions derived depend on how one ‘speculates’ the SUT to
          behave internally. Applying EP under a glass-box or gray-box approach can yield more precise partitions.</p>
        <tip-box>
          <p>📦 Consider the method EPs given above for the <code>isValidMonth</code>. A different tester might use these EPs instead:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>[1 … 12] : the range that produces <code>true</code></li>
            <li>[all other integers] : the range that produces <code>false</code></li>

            <li><code>READY</code> : a new minefield has been created and waiting for player’s first move</li>
            <li><code>IN_PLAY</code> : the current minefield is already in use</li>
            <li><code>WON</code>, <code>LOST</code> : let us assume the <code>newGame</code> behaves the same way for these two values</li>

      <div>
        <p><strong><em>Boundary Value Analysis (BVA)</em> is test case design heuristic that is based on the observation that bugs often result from incorrect handling of boundaries of equivalence partitions.</strong> This is not surprising, as the end points

        <tip-box>
          <p>📦 <code>markCellAt(int x, int y)</code> operation could contain code such as if <code>(x &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; x &lt; = (W-1))</code> which involves boundaries of x’s equivalence partitions.</p>

        <p><strong>Software <em>Quality Assurance</em> (QA) is the process of ensuring that the software being built has the required levels of quality.</strong></p>

          <li>Verification: are we <em>building the system right</em> i.e., are the requirements implemented correctly?</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Whether something belongs under validation or verification is not that important. What is more important is both are done, instead of limiting to verification (i.e., remember that the requirements can be wrong too).</p>

                <p>Pair programming is an agile software development technique in which two programmers work together at one workstation. One, the driver, writes code while the other, the observer or navigator, reviews each line of code as it is typed in.
                  The two programmers switch roles frequently. <sub>[<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming">source: Wikipedia</a>]</sub></p>

              <li>
                <p>Inspections involve a group of people systematically examining a project artifacts to discover defects. Members of the inspection team play various roles during the process, such as:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>the author - the creator of the artifact</li>
                  <li>the moderator - the planner and executor of the inspection meeting</li>
                  <li>the secretary - the recorder of the findings of the inspection</li>

        <p>Static analysis of code can find useful information such unused variables, unhandled exceptions, style errors, and statistics. Most modern IDEs come with some inbuilt static analysis capabilities. For example, an IDE can highlight unused variables
          as you type the code into the editor.</p>
        <p>Higher-end static analyzer tools can perform for more complex analysis such as locating potential bugs, memory leaks, inefficient code structures etc.</p>

        <p>Disadvantages:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>It only proves the compliance with the specification, but not the actual utility of the software.</li>
          <li>It requires highly specialized notations and knowledge which makes it an expensive technique to administer. Therefore, <strong>formal verifications are more commonly used in safety-critical software such as flight control systems</strong>.</li>

          <p><strong>A <em>buffer</em> is a time set aside to absorb any unforeseen delays.</strong> It is very important to include buffers in a software project schedule because effort/time estimations for software development is notoriously hard. However,
            <strong>do not inflate task estimates to create hidden buffers</strong>; have explicit buffers instead. <span class="dimmed"> Reason: With explicit buffers it is easier to detect incorrect effort estimates which can serve as a feedback to improve future effort estimates.</span></p>

          <p>Given below are three commonly used team structures in software development. Irrespective of the team structure, it is a good practice to assign roles and responsibilities to different team members so that someone is clearly in charge of each
            aspect of the project. In comparison, the ‘everybody is responsible for everything’ approach can result in more chaos and hence slower progress.</p>
          <img src="/website/book/teamwork/teamStructures/images/diagram.png" height="150">
          <p></p>
          <p><strong>Egoless team</strong></p>
          <p>In this structure, <strong>every team member is equal in terms of responsibility and accountability</strong>. When any decision is required, consensus must be reached. This team structure is also known as a <em>democratic</em> team structure.
            This team structure usually finds a good solution to a relatively hard problem as all team members contribute ideas.</p>
          <p>However, the democratic nature of the team structure bears a higher risk of falling apart due to the absence of an authority figure to manage the team and resolve conflicts.</p>
          <p><strong>Chief programmer team</strong></p>
          <p>Frederick Brooks proposed that software engineers learn from the medical surgical team in an operating room. In such a team, there is always a chief surgeon, assisted by experts in other areas. Similarly, in a chief programmer team structure,
            <strong>there is a single authoritative figure, the chief programmer</strong>. Major decisions, e.g. system architecture, are made solely by him/her and obeyed by all other team members. The chief programmer directs and coordinates the effort
            of other team members. When necessary, the chief will be assisted by domain specialists e.g. business specialists, database expert, network technology expert, etc. This allows individual group members to concentrate solely on the areas where
            they have sound knowledge and expertise.</p>
          <p>The success of such a team structure relies heavily on the chief programmer. Not only must he be a superb technical hand, he also needs good managerial skills. Under a suitably qualified leader, such a team structure is known to produce successful
            work. .</p>
          <p><strong>Strict hierarchy team</strong></p>
          <p>In the opposite extreme of an egoless team, a strict hierarchy team has <strong>a strictly defined organization among the team members</strong>, reminiscent of the military or bureaucratic government. Each team member only works on his assigned
            tasks and reports to a single “boss”.</p>
          <p>In a large, resource-intensive, complex project, this could be a good team structure to reduce communication overhead.</p>

          <p><strong>Software development goes through different stages such as <em>requirements, analysis, design, implementation</em> and <em>testing</em>.  These stages are collectively known as the <em>software development life cycle</em> (SDLC).</strong>            There are several approaches, known as <em>software development life cycle models</em> (also called <em>software process models</em>) that describe different ways to go through the SDLC. Each process model prescribes a &quot;roadmap&quot;
            for the software developers to manage the development effort. The roadmap describes the aims of the development stage(s), the artifacts or outcome of each stage as well as the workflow i.e. the relationship between stages.</p>

          <p><strong>The <em>sequential model</em>, also called the <em>waterfall</em> model, models software development as a linear process</strong>, in which the project is seen as progressing steadily in one direction through the development stages.
            The name <em>waterfall</em> stems from how the model is drawn to look like a waterfall (see below).</p>
          <img src="/website/book/processModels/introduction/sequentialModels/images/diagram.png" height="180">
          <p></p>
          <p><strong>When one stage of the process is completed, it should produce some artifacts to be used in the next stage.</strong> For example, upon completion of the requirement stage a comprehensive list of requirements is produced that will see
            no further modifications. A strict application of the sequential model would require each stage to be completed before starting the next.</p>
          <p><strong>This could be a useful model when the problem statement that is well-understood and stable.</strong> In such cases, using the sequential model should result in a timely and systematic development effort, provided that all goes well.
            As each stage has a well-defined outcome, the progress of the project can be tracked with a relative ease.</p>
          <p><strong>The major problem with this model is that requirements of a real-world project are rarely well-understood at the beginning and keep changing over time.</strong> One reason for this is that users are generally not aware of how a software
            application can be used without prior experience in using a similar application.</p>

        <div>
          <p><strong>The iterative model (sometimes called <em>iterative</em> and <em>incremental</em>) advocates having several <em>iterations</em> of SDLC.</strong> Each of the iterations could potentially go through all the development stages, from requirement
            gathering to testing &amp; deployment. Roughly, it appears to be similar to several cycles of the sequential model.</p>
          <img src="/website/book/processModels/introduction/iterativeModels/images/diagram.png" height="300">
          <p></p>
          <p><strong>In this model, each of the iterations produces a new version of the product.</strong> Feedback on the version can then be fed to the next iteration. Taking the Minesweeper game as an example, the iterative model will deliver a fully
            playable version from the early iterations. However, the first iteration will have primitive functionality, for example, a clumsy text based UI, fixed board size, limited randomization etc. These functionalities will then be improved in later
            releases.</p>
          <p><strong>The iterative model can take a <em>breadth-first</em> or a <em>depth-first</em> approach to iteration planning.</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>breadth-first</strong>: an iteration evolves all major components in parallel.</li>
            <li><strong>depth-first</strong>: an iteration focuses on fleshing out only some components.</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>Most project use a mixture of breadth-first and depth-first iterations.</strong> Hence, the common phrase ‘an iterative and incremental process’.</p>

          <p>In 2001, a group of prominent software engineering practitioners met and brainstormed for an alternative to documentation-driven, heavyweight software development processes that were used in most large projects at the time. This resulted in
            something called the <em>agile manifesto</em> (a vision statement of what they were looking to do).</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it.</p>
            <p>Through this work we have come to value:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Individuals and interactions</strong> over processes and tools</li>
              <li><strong>Working software</strong> over comprehensive documentation</li>
              <li><strong>Customer collaboration</strong> over contract negotiation</li>
              <li><strong>Responding to change</strong> over following a plan</li>
            </ul>
            <p>That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.<br>
              <sub>Extract from the <a href="http://agilemanifesto.org/">Agile Manifesto</a></sub></p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>Subsequently, some of the signatories of the manifesto went on to create process models that try to follow it. These processes are collectively called agile processes. Some of the key features of agile approaches are:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Requirements are prioritized based on the needs of the user, are clarified regularly (at times almost on a daily basis) with the entire project team, and are factored into the development schedule as appropriate.</li>
            <li>Instead of doing a very elaborate and detailed design and a project plan for the whole project, the team works based on a rough project plan and a high level design that evolves as the project goes on.</li>
            <li>Strong emphasis on complete transparency and responsibility sharing among the team members. The team is responsible together for the delivery of the product. Team members are accountable, and regularly and openly share progress with each other
              and with the user.</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>There are a number of agile processes in the development world today. <em>eXtreme Programming (XP)</em> and <em>Scrum</em> are two of the well-known ones.</strong></p>

            <p><strong>Extreme Programming (XP) stresses customer satisfaction.</strong> Instead of delivering everything you could possibly want on some date far in the future, this process delivers the software you need as you need it.</p>
            <p><strong>XP aims to empower developers to confidently respond to changing customer requirements</strong>, even late in the life cycle.</p>
            <p><strong>XP emphasizes teamwork.</strong> Managers, customers, and developers are all equal partners in a collaborative team. XP implements a simple, yet effective environment enabling teams to become highly productive. The team self-organizes
              around the problem to solve it as efficiently as possible.</p>
            <p><strong>XP aims to improve a software project in five essential ways: communication, simplicity, feedback, respect, and courage.</strong> Extreme Programmers constantly communicate with their customers and fellow programmers. They keep their
              design simple and clean. They get feedback by testing their software starting on day one. Every small success deepens their respect for the unique contributions of each and every team member. With this foundation, Extreme Programmers are
              able to courageously respond to changing requirements and technology.</p>
            <p><strong>XP has a set of simple rules.</strong> XP is a lot like a jig saw puzzle with many small pieces. Individually the pieces make no sense, but when combined together a complete picture can be seen. This flow chart shows how Extreme Programming's
              rules work together.</p>

          <tip-box>
            <p><strong>Scrum is a process skeleton that contains sets of practices and predefined roles. The main roles in Scrum are:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>The Scrum Master</strong>, who maintains the processes (typically in lieu of a project manager)</li>
              <li><strong>The Product Owner</strong>, who represents the stakeholders and the business</li>
              <li><strong>The Team</strong>, a cross-functional group who do the actual analysis, design, implementation, testing, etc.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>A Scrum project is divided into iterations called Sprints.</strong> A sprint is the basic unit of development in Scrum. Sprints tend to last between one week and one month, and are a timeboxed (i.e. restricted to a specific duration)
              effort of a constant length.</p>
            <p><strong>Each sprint is preceded by a planning meeting</strong>, where the tasks for the sprint are identified and an estimated commitment for the sprint goal is made, and followed by a review or retrospective meeting, where the progress is
              reviewed and lessons for the next sprint are identified.</p>
            <p><strong>During each sprint, the team creates a potentially deliverable product increment</strong> (for example, working and tested software). The set of features that go into a sprint come from the product backlog, which is a prioritized set
              of high level requirements of work to be done. Which backlog items go into the sprint is determined during the sprint planning meeting. During this meeting, the Product Owner informs the team of the items in the product backlog that he or
              she wants completed. The team then determines how much of this they can commit to complete during the next sprint, and records this in the sprint backlog. During a sprint, no one is allowed to change the sprint backlog, which means that
              the requirements are frozen for that sprint. Development is timeboxed such that the sprint must end on time; if requirements are not completed for any reason they are left out and returned to the product backlog. After a sprint is completed,
              the team demonstrates the use of the software.</p>
            <p><strong>Scrum enables the creation of self-organizing teams by encouraging co-location of all team members</strong>, and verbal communication between all team members and disciplines in the project.</p>
            <p><strong>A key principle of Scrum is its recognition that during a project the customers can change their minds about what they want and need</strong> (often called requirements churn), and that unpredicted challenges cannot be easily addressed
              in a traditional predictive or planned manner. As such, Scrum adopts an empirical approach—accepting that the problem cannot be fully understood or defined, focusing instead on maximizing the team’s ability to deliver quickly and respond
              to emerging requirements.</p>

          <p><strong><em>Daily Scrum</em> is another key scrum practice</strong>. The description below was adapted from <a href="https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/agile/scrum/meetings/daily-scrum">https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com</a> (emphasis added):</p>
          <tip-box>
            <p><strong>In Scrum, on each day of a sprint, the team holds a daily scrum meeting called the &quot;daily scrum.”</strong> Meetings are typically held in the same location and at the same time each day. Ideally, a daily scrum meeting is held
              in the morning, as it helps set the context for the coming day's work. These scrum meetings are strictly time-boxed to 15 minutes. This keeps the discussion brisk but relevant.</p>
            <p>...</p>
            <p><strong>During the daily scrum, each team member answers the following three questions:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>What did you do yesterday?</li>
              <li>What will you do today?</li>
              <li>Are there any impediments in your way?</li>
            </ul>
            <p>...</p>
            <p>The daily scrum meeting is not used as a problem-solving or issue resolution meeting. <strong>Issues that are raised are taken offline and usually dealt with by the relevant subgroup immediately after the meeting.</strong></p>

          <p>Given above is a visualization of a project done using the Unified process (source: Wikipedia). As the diagram shows, a phase can consist of several iterations. Each vertical column (labeled “I1” “E1”, “E2”, “C1”, etc.) represents a single iteration.
            Each of the iterations consists of a set of ‘workflows’ such as ‘Business modeling’, ‘Requirements’, ‘Analysis &amp; Design’ etc. The shaded region indicates the amount of resource and effort spent on a particular workflow in a particular
            iteration.</p>
          <p><strong>Unified process is a flexible and customizable process model framework rather than a single fixed process.</strong> For example, the number of iterations in each phase, definition of workflows, and the intensity of a given workflow in
            a given iteration can be adjusted according to the nature of the project. Take the Construction Phase, to develop a simple system, one or two iterations would be sufficient. For a more complicated system, multiple iterations will be more helpful.
            Therefore, the diagram above simply records a particular application of the UP rather than prescribe how the UP is to be applied. However, this record can be refined and reused for similar future projects.</p>

        <p><strong><em>Revision Control Software (RCS)</em> are the software tools that automate the process of <em>Revision Control</em> i.e. managing revisions of software artifacts.</strong></p>
        <p>Revision control is also known as <em>Version Control Software (VCS)</em>, and a few other names. Here, we use the terms <em>revision</em> and <em>version</em> interchangeably.</p>
        <tabs>
          <tab header=":abc:">
            <blockquote>
              <p><em>Revision control</em> is the process of managing multiple versions of a piece of information. In its simplest form, this is something that many people do by hand: every time you modify a file, save it under a new name that contains a
                number, each one higher than the number of the preceding version.</p>
              <p>Manually managing multiple versions of even a single file is an error-prone task, though, so software tools to help automate this process have long been available. The earliest automated revision control tools were intended to help a single
                user to manage revisions of a single file. Over the past few decades, the scope of revision control tools has expanded greatly; they now manage multiple files, and help multiple people to work together. The best modern revision control
                tools have no problem coping with thousands of people working together on projects that consist of hundreds of thousands of files.</p>
              <p>There are a number of reasons why you or your team might want to use an automated revision control tool for a project. It will track the history and evolution of your project, so you don't have to. For every change, you'll have a log of
                who made it; why they made it; when they made it; and what the change was.</p>
              <p>When you're working with other people, <strong>revision control software makes it easier for you to collaborate</strong>. For example, when people more or less simultaneously make potentially incompatible changes, the software will help
                you to identify and resolve those conflicts.</p>
              <p><strong>It can help you to recover from mistakes</strong>. If you make a change that later turns out to be an error, you can revert to an earlier version of one or more files. In fact, a really good revision control tool will even help you
                to efficiently figure out exactly when a problem was introduced.</p>
              <p><strong>It will help you to work simultaneously on, and manage the drift between, multiple versions of your project.</strong> Most of these reasons are equally valid, at least in theory, whether you're working on a project by yourself, or
                with a hundred other people.</p>
