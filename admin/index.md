# TE3201 Software Engineering

* [Lectures](#lectures)
* [Project](#project)
* [Learning Materials](#learning-materials)
* [Exam](#exam)
* [Grading](#grading)

## Lectures 

TUE 1800-2130 in E3‐06‐02

* :worried: No webcast (Reason: the lecture venue does not have the webcast facility)

* The lecture will be broken into small segments (about 30 minutes) of fairly independent parts so that late comers can still follow the remainder of the lecture.

* First 15 minutes will be a recap of previous lecture or free-flow discussion so that those slightly late will not miss the beginning of the lecture proper.

* Python topics will be in the 2nd half of the lecture so that those not interested in learning Python can leave early.

## Project

To be done in individually, or teams of 2-3 members.

**Programming language**: The recommended language is Python but another Object-Oriented language (e.g. Java, C#, C++, ...) is acceptable if there is consensus among team members.

### Software to build

You will be building a personal assistant chat-bot software named _PAC_ (_PAC_ is a temporary name; you should give a different name to your own chat bot)
 
**_Basic_ Functionality**:

1. PAC interface can be text-based (i.e., no need for a graphical UI)
1. PAC helps with storing and retrieving at least **one type of data** that is useful to the user. Some examples of different types of data (you can pick one of them): details of contacts, todo items, appointments, deadlines, reminders, technical terms to remember, etc. Here is an example interaction between a user and a PAC that deals with TODO items:
   ```
   >> Hi, I'm PAC. What can I do to help you with your TODOs?
   
   add Return library book
   >> TODO added: Return library book
   
   list
   >> Here are the list of TODOs you have:
   1. Return library book
   2. Do TE3201 exercises
   3. Call back Jina
   
   delete 2
   >> TODO deleted: Do TE3201 exercises
   
   are you single?
   >> Sorry. I did not understand your request.
   
   help
   >> Here are the requests I understand.
   add {TODO description} : adds a TODO to the list
   list : lists all TODOs
   ...
   
   ```

1. There is **no need for PAC to be able to understand natural language** sentences. It is fine for the user requests to need to follow a strict format. Defining the request format is part of the project. The example interaction given above is just an example only. Hint: try to design a request format that is easy to remember and type.
1. PAC should support **adding, deleting, listing, searching** (by keyword) of data items.
1. _Persistence_: The data should be **stored in the hard disk** so that restarting PAC should not cause a loss of data entered in a previous session. 
   1. The data files should be in a human-readable format such as `.csv` (recommended), `xml`, `json`, plain text, etc.


Basic functionality given above counts as 2 _units_ of functionality. On top of that, you are required to add some more _additional functionality_ (of your own choice). The total amount of functionality required is given below.

Team size | Total amount of functionality
--------- | -----------------------
1-person  | 3-4 units
2-persons | 4-5 units
3-persons | 5-6 units

**_Additional_ Functionality**:

Some suggestions for _additional functionality_:
* More attributes for data items e.g., priorities, tags, birthdays
* Multiple data item types e.g., support saving TODOs, appointments, and deadlines
  * Support connections between data items e.g., ability to assign a TODO to a contact
* Multi-user support e.g., assume the software is installed in a common computer in your office and allow multiple users to interact with it
* More ways to query data e.g., find contacts that has a birthday in next 2 days, find all TODOs with high priority, etc.
* Any other feature (get approval from prof before implementing)

### Constraints

1. You should not use relational/SQL databases e.g., MySQL
1. The software should work in a Windows computer that has the latest releases of Java, .NET, and Python 3.
   1. If your software need other software to be installed (e.g., third-party libraries), please get prof's permission first.

### Deliverables

* **Week 8** (mid-term submission): 10%
  * Deadline: Week 8, Tuesday 6pm
  * Functionality: at least most of the basic requirements are fulfilled (you may leave out the _persistence_ requirement)
    * Submission: demo during lecture in week 8
  * Documentation: 
    * Sections to include:
      * Cover page: Include product name, names of team members 
      * User stories: Give user stories to cover all current and future functionalities
      * Use cases: Give 2-3 use case descriptions. Choose use cases that require most number of steps or most complicated.
      * Non-functional requirements: Give 5-10 NFRs for the project. Try to include a diverse range of NFRs.
      * Activity Diagrams: Give at least one activity diagram related to the product e.g., an AD that explains a workflow of how the user uses your product or an algorithm in the code. You can use any drawing software (e.g. PowerPoint), or hand-sketch and photograph/scan the diagrams.
    * Submission: upload to IVLE as a `.docx` or `.pdf` file. File name should contain team member names. e.g., `John Doe, Sarah Tan, Viet Ngoc.docx`

* **Week 13** (final submission): 30%
  * Functionality: all functionality
    * Submission: 
      * Zip up all source files, upload to IVLE. File name should contain member names. :alarm_clock: Deadline: week 13 Monday midnight.
      * Demo the product during week 13 lecture. Each person should demo the features s/he implemented.
  * Documentation: 
    * Include all content included in mid-term submission. ==Refine as per feedback given.==
    * Add a **class diagram** to represent the design of your software. If your software is not an OOP solution, draw the diagram to match how you _propose_ to design your software in an OOP approach, if you were to do the project again. [<trigger trigger="click" for="modal:finalSubmission-classDiagram">example</trigger>]
    * Add an **object diagram** to represent the state of your software after the user has entered some data (assuming your software follows the class diagram above). [<trigger trigger="click" for="modal:finalSubmission-objectDiagram">example</trigger>]
    * Give a sample of **test cases** you would use to test the software.
      * <tooltip content="if you are a 2-person team, give 4 test cases">2 x TEAM_SIZE</tooltip> System test cases: Describe what feature is being tested, steps the tester should take, inputs at various steps, and expected outputs. These tests can be manual or automated. [<trigger trigger="click" for="modal:finalSubmission-systemTests">example</trigger>]
      * Unit test cases for <tooltip content="if you are a 2-person team, give test cases for 2 functions">TEAM_SIZE</tooltip> functions/methods in the code: Give inputs and expected outputs. It is not necessary that for you to actually implement these tests in code; just describe the purpose of the test case, inputs, and expected output. [<trigger trigger="click" for="modal:finalSubmission-unitTests">example</trigger>]
    * Submission: As before, upload to IVLE in docx or pdf format. File name should contain member names. :alarm_clock: Deadline: week 13 Monday midnight.

## Sample System Tests
 
**Test case 1: Launch without prior data**
* Feature being tested : launch of app, without any prior data
* Set up: 
  1. Delete all files in the `/data/` folder.
* Steps:
  1. Run the app using the command `python main.py`
  1. Confirm the the app shows a welcome screen and a summary of commands, as shown below:<br>
     {screenshot here}

**Test case 2: Add first contact**
* Feature being tested : adding of a contact when there are no prior data
* Set up: 
  1. Launch app without any prior data (similar to `Test case 1` above).
* Steps:
  Input | Expected
  ----- | --------
  Enter command `add` | app shows error message and show the correct format of the `add` command
  Enter command<br> `add John Doe` | app shows list of contacts containing only one person<br> {screenshot here}
  
</modal>

<modal large id="modal:finalSubmission-unitTests">

## Sample Unit Tests
 
**Function being tested : `add_contact(current_contacts, new_contact)`**

Description of the function: appends the `Person` object `new_contact` to the `current_contacts` (a list of `Person` objects) if it doesn't contain that person already.

`current_contacts` | `new_contact` | Expected `current_contacts`
---------------- | ----------- | --------
`[]` | `Person('John')` | `[Person('John')]`
`[Person('John')]` | `Person('John')` | `[Person('John')]`
`[Person('John')]` | `Person('Amy')` | `[Person('John'), Person('Amy')]`
